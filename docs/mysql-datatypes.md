# MySQL datatypes

Using the right datatype is important when creating a database. This can influence how fast queries are computed. 
Here are the most important types with their description.

---

### Text types:

Type|Description|Maximum Length
----|-----------|--------------
CHAR()|Stores a string with a fixed length that is typed between the brackets|255 characters
VARCHAR()|Stores a string with a variable length, where the maximum length is given between the brackets| 255 characters
TINYTEXT|Stores a string, like a varchar(255)| 255 characters
TEXT| Stores a larger string|65,535 characters
MEDIUMTEXT| Stores an even larger string|16,777,215 characters
MEDIUMBLOB| Stores a BLOB (Binary Large OBjects, can be a picture for example)|16,777,215 bytes
LONGTEXT| Stores a huge string|4,294,967,295 characters
LONGBLOB| Stores a huge BLOB|4,294,967,295 bytes
ENUM(x,y,z,...)|With this, you can make a list of the possible values|65535 values
SET|Same as an ENUM but holds a lot less items, but you can store more than one choice|64 values

### Number Types:

 'size' represents the total number of digits and 'dec' represents the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

Type|Description|Signed Range|Unsigned Range
----|-----------|------------|--------------
TINYINT(size)|Very small integer|-128 to 127| 0 to 255
SMALLINT(size)|Small integer|-32,768 to 32,767| 0 to 65,535
MEDIUMINT(size)|Medium integer|-8,388,608 to 8,388,607| 0 to 16,777,215
INT(size)|Normal integer|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647| 0 to 4,294,967,295
BIGINT(size)|Extremely big integer|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
FLOAT(size,dec)|A small number with a floating decimal point.
DOUBLE(size,dec)|A large number with a floating decimal point.
DECIMAL(size,d)|A DOUBLE stored as a string, allowing for a fixed decimal point.

Generally, float values are good for scientific Calculations, but should not be used for financial/monetary values. For business oriented math, always use Decimal.

### Date Types:

Type|Description|Format|Range
----|-----------|------|-----
DATE()|A date|YYYY-MM-DD|'1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'
DATETIME()|A date and time|YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS| '1000-01-01 00:00:00' to '9999-12-31 23:59:59'
TIMESTAMP()|A date and time that is stored as the number of seconds since the Unix epoch. This value also automatically updates to the current time when doing an INSERT or UPDATE|YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS|'1970-01-01 00:00:01' UTC to '2038-01-09 03:14:07' UTC
TIME()|A time|HH:MI:SS|'-838:59:59' to '838:59:59'
YEAR()|A year|YYYY|'1901' to '2155'

### Examples:

This is an example for an ENUM and SET:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dogs(
id int(5) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
chip_id int(5),
gender enum('male', 'female'),
coat_color set('black', 'white', 'brown', 'beige'),
primary key(id)
);

INSERT INTO dogs(name, chip_id, gender, coat_color)
VALUES
('Toby', 7865, 'male', 'brown,beige'),
('Medoc', 8776, 'male', 'brown'),
('Luna', 7654, 'female', 'black,white'),
('Alien', 666, 'alien', 'green');
```
We just made a new table using an ENUM for the gender, and a SET for coat color. We use a set for that because a dog can have multiple colors. We also added a weird row with values that do not exist in the ENUM or SET.

```
+----+-------+---------+--------+-------------+
| id | name  | chip_id | gender | coat_color  |
+----+-------+---------+--------+-------------+
|  1 | Toby  |    7865 | male   | brown,beige |
|  2 | Medoc |    8776 | male   | brown       |
|  3 | Luna  |    7654 | female | black,white |
|  4 | Alien |     666 |        |             |
+----+-------+---------+--------+-------------+
```
Here we see the result after doing a SELECT all on the table. You can see that there are multiple values for coat_color. Also the gender and coat_color for the 'Alien' dog are blank, the database defaults the value to '' when an non-existent value is inserted, a blank value will take its place.
