<h1>Cardinality</h1>
We describe how tables relate to one another using cardinality, below are some cardinalities

Furthermore certain relations between entities can either be mandatory or optional this is indicated as following :
<ul>
  <li>A mandatory relation is indicated by a "+"</li>
  <li>An optional relation is indicated by a "O"</li>
</ul>

<h1>Different ERD's</h1>
In total there are three distinct types of ERD :
<ul>
  <li>Conceptual ERD</li>
  <li>Logical ERD</li>
  <li>Physical ERD</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Conceptual ERD</h3>
A conceptual ERD only displays the entities and their relations, the contents of each entity isn't displayed here

<h3>Logical ERD</h3>
A logical ERD diplays the relations between entities aswell as there contents but the specifics of the contents remain still untouched<br>

<h3>Physical ERD</h3>
A physical ERD displays the relations between the entities, their contents aswell as there specifics. This is the final designing stage in constructing an ERD neccesary to construct a database

<h1>Key fields</h1>
There are 2 types of key fields :
<ul>
  <li>Primary key</li>
  <li>Foreign key</li>
</ul>

<b>A primary key</b> assigns a field to its "special order table", for example : the "Doctor Last Name" field might be assigned as a primary key of the Doctor table with all people having same last name organized alphabetically according to the first three letters of their first name.<br>

<b>A foreign key</b> indicates that field is linked to the primary key of another table.
